# Breakout by taha

This version of super breakout includes many new features.
Using classes for the bricks, the paddle, and the ball, the basic
features of the game are made. A second paddle is added for two-player
compatibility. Score and lives remaining are displayed at the top.

Background music is played, and sound effects are played whenever the ball
hits the paddle, the brick, and the bottom of the screen
